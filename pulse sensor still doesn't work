I can not use analog pin0 because it will break the circuit. 
The pulse sensor still doesn't work, so I try to Turn On ASCII Visualizer

// Regards Serial OutPut  -- Set This Up to your needs
static boolean serialVisual = false;   // Set to 'false' by Default.

But I only read S175 S150 S 160...
I think the problem is the pulse sensor. I may change another pulse sensor.
